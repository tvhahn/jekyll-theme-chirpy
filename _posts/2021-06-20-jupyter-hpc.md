> Setting up and running Jupyter notebooks in a high performance computing environment is easy! This tutorial will show you how.

I've been using a high performance computing (HPC) environment for more than two years -- I use the [Compute Canada](https://www.computecanada.ca/) system. It's amazing! No data set is too large. No need to worry about frying my local GPU. So many fun things to explore.... Having access to this system is a serious perk to my job!

Here's a little tutorial on how to setup and run a Jupyter notebook on the Compute Canada HPC system. I made it as straightforward as possible so the new students could follow along. Maybe you'll find it useful too!

The GitHub repo is here with the step-by-step instructions: [github.com/tvhahn/compute-canada-hpc](https://github.com/tvhahn/compute-canada-hpc)
